# busbar-auth-oidc

The OIDC auth module as a droppable busbar plugin: a cdylib exporting the auth C ABI. Drop it in the plugins folder and add oidc to auth.chain with its settings nested under it.

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The first-party, signed `kind: auth` plugin for
[busbar](https://getbusbar.com): verifies a caller's identity by checking
a bearer JWT against an OpenID Connect identity provider's JWKS — real
signature verification (RS256 and ES256 on [`ring`](https://github.com/briansmith/ring),
no `jsonwebtoken`/`rsa`), issuer/audience/expiry/not-before checks, and a
claim-to-role mapping — then hands busbar a `Principal` it can bind to
virtual keys and roles.

It is a `cdylib` that implements busbar's `AuthModule` trait (via
[`busbar-contract`](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar/tree/main/crates/busbar-contract))
and is loaded in-process by busbar over the signed hybrid plugin ABI —
`dlopen`'d, not spawned as a separate process.

### Versioning

This plugin is versioned **independently of busbar** — `v1.0.0` here says
nothing about which busbar release it is. Compatibility with busbar is
stated separately: **requires busbar 1.6.0+** (contract ABI 3, which this
crate declares in `auth-oidc/declares.json`; busbar 1.5.x speaks an older
auth ABI and refuses to load it). Pin both versions
explicitly in production; do not assume they move together.


- **Verifying who's calling**: define an entry under `identity-providers:`
  with its `settings:` pointed at an IdP (Entra ID, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak,
  or any standards-compliant OIDC provider) and reference it by name from
  `auth.chain` — `identity-providers: { corp-oidc: { module: oidc,
  settings: {...} } }` + `auth: { chain: [keys, corp-oidc] }`. Every
  request's bearer token is verified
  against the IdP's live JWKS — the plugin never trusts an unsigned
  claim.
- **Mapping claims to busbar identity**: the configured role claim (e.g.
  `groups`) becomes the `Principal`'s roles, which busbar's virtual-key
  and policy layer can then gate on — so an operator's existing IdP
  groups drive busbar access without a second identity system.

### Design

This repo is a same-repo, 2-crate Cargo workspace: `auth-oidc/` (the
`busbar-auth-oidc` library — the real OIDC logic, no plugin ABI) and
`auth-oidc-plugin/` (the `busbar-auth-oidc-plugin` cdylib adapter).

`auth-oidc-plugin/src/lib.rs` is a thin adapter: one line,
`busbar_contract::export_door!(busbar_auth_oidc::door::door)`, which emits
the image's one symbol, `busbar_plugin_door` (the memory-ABI door). The
module and its settings parsing live in the logic crate.
All the actual OIDC logic — JWKS fetch/cache, JWT verification, claim
policy — lives in the `busbar-auth-oidc` library crate (`auth-oidc/`, a
same-repo sibling crate; see [Dependencies](#dependencies) below), so a
custom build can also link that logic statically instead of going
through the plugin ABI.

`jwks_url` in the config is optional: when omitted, it is resolved once
at `open()` via the issuer's OIDC discovery document, so boot fails
loudly if discovery can't find it rather than deferring the failure to
the first request.

## Config

| Setting | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issuer` | yes | — | The IdP's OIDC issuer URL. Checked against the JWT's `iss` claim. |
| `audience` | yes | — | The expected `aud` claim (busbar's registered client/resource identifier at the IdP). |
| `jwks_url` | no | discovered from `issuer` | The IdP's JWKS endpoint. Must be an `https` URL (anything else is refused at load). When omitted, resolved once at `open()` via OIDC discovery (`<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`). |
| `role_claim` | no | `groups` | The claim mapped onto the resulting `Principal`'s roles; set `roles` to use Entra app-roles instead. |
| `jwks_min_refetch_secs` | no | `60` | JWKS refetch rate-limit (seconds) — the bound on how often a kid-rotation refetch can occur. |
| `jwks_ttl_secs` | no | `3600` | JWKS cache TTL (seconds). |
| `ca_cert_pem` | no | — | An extra root CA (PEM) to trust for the JWKS/discovery HTTPS fetch, in addition to the built-in public (webpki) roots; the OS trust store is not consulted — for a private CA or a test fixture (this is exactly what `tests/e2e.rs` uses to trust its own self-signed local JWKS server). |
| `client_id` | no | `audience` | The OAuth `client_id` presented on the browser-login authorize URL and token exchange. The client secret is never set here; busbar core holds it. |
| `scopes` | no | `[]` | Extra OAuth scopes requested at browser login, on top of the always-sent `openid`. |
| `authorization_endpoint` | no | discovered from `issuer` | The IdP authorize endpoint for browser login. When omitted, taken from the discovery document at `open()`; absent and undiscoverable means browser login is refused (token verification is unaffected). |
| `token_endpoint` | no | discovered from `issuer` | The IdP token endpoint for the browser-login code exchange. Discovered like `authorization_endpoint` when omitted. |

Unknown config fields are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) — a typo'd or
stray key fails loudly at boot instead of being silently ignored.

## Build

Needs a Rust toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs)); `rust-toolchain.toml` pins
the version CI uses. busbar is a pinned git dependency (see
[Dependencies](#dependencies) below).

```sh
cargo build --release      # cdylib: target/release/libbusbar_auth_oidc_plugin.{so,dylib}
cargo test                 # unit tests + the end-to-end loader/JWKS/JWT test (see tests/e2e.rs)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Dependencies

`busbar-auth-oidc` (`auth-oidc/`) is a same-repo crate; `auth-oidc-plugin`
depends on it as a normal workspace path dependency (`../auth-oidc`).

The one [busbar](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar) crate either crate
names is `busbar-contract` — the plugin contract, whose `abi::sdk` module
carries the export macros. `busbar-plugin-loader` is a dev-dependency only,
for the linked + dropped-in conformance test and the end-to-end test. Both
are **git dependencies pinned to one busbar commit**: the `rev` in every
`Cargo.toml` is field 1 of `.busbar-ref`, and CI's `pin` job refuses a
manifest that disagrees. No sibling checkout of busbar is needed to build
or test; the live end-to-end test (`tests/e2e.rs`) builds the real `busbar`
binary from a checkout named by `BUSBAR_CHECKOUT` (CI's `e2e` job provides
one at `.busbar-ref`).

### Pack and sign

Once built, the cdylib is packed and signed like any other busbar plugin
— see
[`docs/plugins.md`](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar/blob/main/docs/plugins.md#signing-and-packaging)
in busbar for the full reference. In short:

```sh
BUSBAR_SIGN_KEY=<signing key> busbar-plugin-pack pack \
    --lib target/release/libbusbar_auth_oidc_plugin.so \
    --name busbar-auth-oidc-plugin --alias oidc --kind auth \
    --version 1.0.0 --publisher busbar \
    --license Apache-2.0 \
    --out busbar-auth-oidc-plugin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```

For local development without a signing key, `busbar-plugin-pack pack
--allow-unsigned` produces a tarball busbar loads only under
`plugins.trust.allow_unsigned: true`.

Drop the resulting tarball into busbar's configured `plugins.dir` and
set:

```yaml
identity-providers:
  corp-oidc:                 # the NAME is the instance; `module:` is the plugin behind it
    module: oidc
    settings:
      issuer: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0"
      audience: "<client-id>"
      role_claim: groups
    # max_admin_scope:       # per-provider admin ceiling; OMITTED = the most restrictive
                             # (read-only). Never widen an external IdP to `full` casually.

auth:
  chain: [keys, corp-oidc]   # built-ins (`keys`, `admin-tokens`) are referenced bare
```

Claim-to-role mapping is keyed by that same provider name:

```yaml
auth:
  role_bindings:
    corp-oidc:
      "<sso-group>": { group: engineering }
```

— see [`docs/configuration.md`](https://github.com/GetBusbar/busbar/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#auth-plugins)
for the full `identity-providers:` / `auth.chain` config reference.

## Tests

`cargo test` runs both `auth-oidc-plugin`'s own hermetic unit tests
(`auth-oidc-plugin/src/lib.rs` — covering `open()`'s config-parsing
responsibility: empty/malformed/missing-required-field/unknown-field
config, and the "explicit `jwks_url` skips discovery" and "malformed
issuer fails fast" paths, all without any network I/O) and the
end-to-end test in `auth-oidc-plugin/tests/e2e.rs`. (`auth-oidc/` has
its own unit tests too — `auth-oidc/src/tests.rs` — covering the JWT/JWKS
logic itself; both crates' tests run under a workspace-wide `cargo
test`.)

The end-to-end test is NOT a stub: it stands up a genuine local HTTPS
JWKS server (a real self-signed certificate minted with `rcgen`, served
over a real `rustls` TLS listener on `127.0.0.1`), mints a real
ES256-signed JWT with `ring`, and `dlopen`s the actually-built
`busbar-auth-oidc-plugin` cdylib over `busbar-plugin-loader`'s real
`kind: auth` C ABI seam — the same seam busbar's engine uses. It proves,
entirely offline (no external IdP, no Docker service):

- a genuine JWKS fetch over real TLS, trusted via the plugin's own
  `ca_cert_pem` config field;
- genuine ES256 signature verification (a token signed by the fixture's
  key is accepted and its claims mapped to a `Principal`; a token signed
  by a *different* key with the same `kid` is rejected);
- the full claim → `Principal` mapping (`sub`/`preferred_username`/
  `name`/the configured role claim) survives the round trip across the
  real C ABI, not just in-process Rust calls;
- a load-time config error (empty config, or config missing a required
  field) surfaces back across the ABI as a clean `Err`, never a panic or
  a silently-succeeded load.

Build under `cargo test --workspace`-equivalent (i.e. a normal `cargo
build` first, or just `cargo test`, which builds the cdylib as part of
the test run) so the e2e test finds the library; it self-skips with a
message if the cdylib isn't present locally, but hard-fails under CI
(`CI` env var set) instead of silently skipping — this is the only
over-the-ABI coverage of the `kind: auth` dlopen seam and must never
quietly vanish.
