//! THE MODULE'S WAY OUT, THROUGH THE HOST (THE DESIGN 5, Connections: "No plugin opens a socket,
//! dials, binds or does TLS"; OWNER LAW 2026-09-27: the reqwest users move onto kernel
//! transports). The module states three outbound needs ([`NEEDS`]) and makes every request as ONE
//! framed `exchange()` over the host's connector ([`HostIo`]): the issuer's discovery document, the
//! JWKS, and the login's code-for-token POST. Each answers PENDING while it is in flight and is
//! re-asked when the op re-enters on its wake (the replay rule, `abi::sdk::conn`).
//!
//! Every need is `open-web` (public destinations over a secure connection only; the auth mint
//! endpoints' class), over the `http` transport, its connections secured by the target's `https`
//! scheme (the connector's TLS; open-web is secure-only). The discovery need is pinned to the `issuer` setting's target
//! (`target_from`); the JWKS and token endpoints may be discovered, so the module names them per
//! request.
//!
//! `ca_cert_pem` is OPTIONAL, as it was in 1.5.5 (an extra root on top of the public ones, never a
//! replacement). The host's connector refuses a need whose `trust_from` resolves to nothing, so
//! the three needs are stated twice: the ANCHORED set trusts `ca_cert_pem` (`trust_from`), the
//! PUBLIC set trusts the public roots only. A module whose settings name a `ca_cert_pem` goes out
//! on the anchored set, any other on the public set ([`HostIo::new`]); the set it does not use is
//! never asked for a connection (the anchored set of a module with no `ca_cert_pem` is refused at
//! declaration, and stays unused).
//!
//! What the module reads back keeps 1.5.5's words: [`document`] (a non-2xx GET, the 1 MiB cap, a
//! body that is not UTF-8) and [`failed`] (a request that never got an answer, the connector's own
//! text after 1.5.5's prefix).
