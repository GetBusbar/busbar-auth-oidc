//! The JWKS cache: fetch-on-demand, TTL refresh, and a BOUNDED refetch — when a token names a `kid`
//! absent from the cached set (the provider rotated its signing key), refetch once, rate-limited,
//! and retry. Guards against a bogus-`kid` flood turning into a fetch storm.
//!
//! ## Sans-IO single-flight (THE DESIGN, auth)
//!
//! The cache never blocks and never dials: its fetch is the caller's [`Fetch`], which answers
//! PENDING while the caller's own exchange is in flight. A cold key id pends `verify`; ONE caller
//! claims the fetch (the [`Flight`]) and its op re-enters on its exchange's wake; every other caller
//! with nothing to serve answers [`Step::Wait`] and asks again shortly, taking the winner's keys once
//! they land. A caller that already holds a usable key set never waits on another's fetch: it serves
//! from what it has while the winner refreshes. The cache's lock is held for the microseconds it
//! takes to clone an `Arc` or write one back — never across a fetch, never across a signature
//! verification (`f` runs on a snapshot with nothing held).
//!
//! ## Why every fetch trigger is rate-limited
//!
//! Every trigger — cold start, TTL-stale, and unknown-`kid` rotation alike — goes through the same
//! `min_refetch_interval` rate limit anchored on the last fetch ATTEMPT (failures included).
//! Bounding the rotation path alone is not enough: because `fetched_at` advances only on success, an
//! unreachable IdP would leave the set permanently TTL-stale and every single request would issue its
//! own fresh GET — an unbounded fetch storm against the provider.
