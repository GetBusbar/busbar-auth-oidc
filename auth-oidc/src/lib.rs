//! **OIDC auth module** for busbar — the first identity-provider auth PLUGIN. Validates an OpenID
//! Connect JWT (ID or access token) a caller presents as its bearer credential and maps it to a
//! [`busbar_contract::auth::Principal`]: verify the signature against the provider's JWKS, check `iss`/`aud`/
//! `exp`/`nbf`, and read the configured role claim (`groups` by default, or `roles` for Entra
//! app-roles) into the principal's ROLES. busbar's own `auth.role_bindings:` config
//! then resolves those roles to governance grants and admin scope — the module asserts identity
//! only, never policy.
//!
//! This crate is the LOGIC and its door ([`door::door`], on the auth kind's memory ABI): a build that
//! links it registers that door, and the dropped-in `cdylib`, the sibling `busbar-auth-oidc-plugin`
//! crate, exports the same door as `busbar_plugin_door`.
//!
//! ## Crypto & dependencies
//!
//! Signature verification runs on `ring` — the crypto backend the whole workspace already uses (via
//! rustls). NO `jsonwebtoken`/`rsa`: that avoids RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (the Marvin RSA-timing advisory)
//! and a second crypto stack. Crypto lives HERE in the plugin crate,
//! never in busbar core.
//!
//! ## Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) gotchas — handled here
//!
//! - **issuer** is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`, **aud** is the app's
//!   client-id. Both are exact-matched.
//! - **group claims are GUIDs**, not names: the operator maps those GUIDs in `auth.role_bindings:`.
//! - **>200 groups overage**: Entra omits the `groups` claim and instead emits `_claim_names` /
//!   `_claim_sources` markers pointing at the Graph API. busbar does NOT call Graph and does NOT
//!   silently degrade: [`OidcVerifier`] REJECTS such a token with a precise error pointing the
//!   operator at **app-roles** (`role_claim: roles`), whose count is bounded.
