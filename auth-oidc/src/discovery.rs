//! THE ISSUER'S DISCOVERY DOCUMENT (`<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`), fetched once, on
//! the first op that needs it, sans-IO single-flight like the JWKS ([`crate::cache`]): the claimer's
//! op pends on its exchange, a caller arriving meanwhile waits, and every later op reads the
//! resolved document. It names the JWKS url when `jwks_url` is not configured, and whichever login
//! endpoint is not. A failed fetch is remembered with its error for `jwks_min_refetch_secs`, so an
//! unreachable issuer is asked again at the JWKS cache's own retry bound, never per request.
//!
//! RFC 8414 §3.3 / OIDC Discovery 1.0 §4.3: the document's own `issuer` MUST equal the issuer it
//! was requested from. Without this check, one poisoned discovery response repoints `jwks_uri` (and
//! the login endpoints) — and therefore every future signature verification — at an
//! attacker-controlled key set. Callers whose URLs are configured explicitly never fetch it.
